## Custom Coloring
The following possibilites exist for custom coloring the data

  - Via the Temperature and TRH color palette
  - Via the two user definded variales in the settings - any number of color palettes, and any number of "keywords" those color palettes are associated with. (XXX explain better)
  
  If one of the user-defined characters is detected in the column name, the associated color palette is automatically used for coloring these data.
  XXX explain better.
